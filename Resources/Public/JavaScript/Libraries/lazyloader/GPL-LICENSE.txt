9	          Preamble
10	
11	  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
12	freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
13	License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
14	software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
15	General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
16	Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
17	using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
18	the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
19	your programs, too.
20	
21	  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
22	price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
23	have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
24	this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
25	if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
26	in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
27	
28	  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
29	anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
30	These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
31	distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
32	
33	  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
34	gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
35	you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
36	source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
37	rights.
38	
39	  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
40	(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
41	distribute and/or modify the software.
42	
43	  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
44	that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
45	software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
46	want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
47	that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
48	authors' reputations.
49	
50	  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
51	patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
52	program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
53	program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
54	patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
55	
56	  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
57	modification follow.
58	
59	        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
60	   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
61	
62	  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
63	a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
64	under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
65	refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
66	means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
67	that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
68	either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
69	language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
70	the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
71	
72	Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
73	covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
74	running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
75	is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
76	Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
77	Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
78	
79	  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
80	source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
81	conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
82	copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
83	notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
84	and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
85	along with the Program.
86	
87	You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
88	you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
89	
90	  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
91	of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
92	distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
93	above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
94	
95	    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
96	    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
97	
98	    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
99	    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
100	    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
101	    parties under the terms of this License.
102	
103	    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
104	    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
105	    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
106	    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
107	    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
108	    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
109	    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
110	    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
111	    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
112	    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
113	
114	These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
115	identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
116	and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
117	themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
118	sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
119	distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
120	on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
121	this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
122	entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
123	
124	Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
125	your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
126	exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
127	collective works based on the Program.
128	
129	In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
130	with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
131	a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
132	the scope of this License.
133	
134	  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
135	under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
136	Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
137	
138	    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
139	    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
140	    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
141	
142	    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
143	    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
144	    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
145	    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
146	    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
147	    customarily used for software interchange; or,
148	
149	    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
150	    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
151	    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
152	    received the program in object code or executable form with such
153	    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
154	
155	The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
156	making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
157	code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
158	associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
159	control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
160	special exception, the source code distributed need not include
161	anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
162	form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
163	operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
164	itself accompanies the executable.
165	
166	If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
167	access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
168	access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
169	distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
170	compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
171	
172	  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
173	except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
174	otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
175	void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
176	However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
177	this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
178	parties remain in full compliance.
179	
180	  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
181	signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
182	distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
183	prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
184	modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
185	Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
186	all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
187	the Program or works based on it.
188	
189	  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
190	Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
191	original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
192	these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
193	restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
194	You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
195	this License.
196	
197	  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
198	infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
199	conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
200	otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
201	excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
202	distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
203	License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
204	may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
205	license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
206	all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
207	the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
208	refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
209	
210	If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
211	any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
212	apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
213	circumstances.
214	
215	It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
216	patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
217	such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
218	integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
219	implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
220	generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
221	through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
222	system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
223	to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
224	impose that choice.
225	
226	This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
227	be a consequence of the rest of this License.
228	
229	  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
230	certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
231	original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
232	may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
233	those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
234	countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
235	the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
236	
237	  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
238	of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
239	be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
240	address new problems or concerns.
241	
242	Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
243	specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
244	later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
245	either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
246	Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
247	this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
248	Foundation.
249	
250	  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
251	programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
252	to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
253	Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
254	make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
255	of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
256	of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
257	
258	          NO WARRANTY
259	
260	  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
261	FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
262	OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
263	PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
264	OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
265	MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
266	TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
267	PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
268	REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
269	
270	  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
271	WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
272	REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
273	INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
274	OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
275	TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
276	YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
277	PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
278	POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
